### Get started
- If you haven't already downloaded Hyper Dash on your machine head on over to either [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1386890/Hyper_Dash/) or the [Rift Store](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/pcvr/2801247513273368/) to start downloading!

- Download the latest version of Auto Follow from the [Releases](https://github.com/SleepyGabes/AutoFollow/releases).

- Unzip the contents from the zip file wherever.

- Run the executable file "`AutoFollow.exe`".

- Press "Set new target" and put your current name in Hyper Dash.
  > Without the clan tag included.

- AutoFollow will then automatically switch windows to Hyper Dash.
  > Make sure you have Hyper Dash running.

- Now join a lobby and the program will be able to follow you from lobby to lobby.
  > Sometimes you will have to manually check yourself if the program is running correctly. Because it can sometimes get stuck within the menus.

- Happy Dashing!

## Requirements for the script to work correctly:

- Preferably 1920 x 1080p Monitor
> You can change the mouse points for the program and where to read the top scoreboard in `config.json`.

- Oculus or Steam version of Hyper Dash.

- Hyper Dash running fullscreen.

## Recommended Spectator Settings
- FOV = 90

- Spectator UI = true

- Follow on kill = false
